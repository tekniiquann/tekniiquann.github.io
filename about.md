Hello! I am Quann. This is my personal website and technology blogs. I have Ph.D Degree of applied mathematics and mathematical physics.

I have been worked and conducted scientific researches with HPC about p-wave superfluid of liquid Helium-3 over decade. The topics of physics I've worked on and published papers are 
- String and monopole topological defects and composite topological defects in symmetry breaking system.
- Phase transition dynamics simulations and formations of topological and non-topological defects.
- Spin collective modes in p-wave superfluid and their Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) signals. 
- Pair density wave and spatial modulations of order parameters of p-wave superfluid.
- Emergent gravitational physics in p-wave superfluid with Wyel points. 

My researches massively take advantages of powerful modern computational hardwares available on High Performance Computing platform. The algorithms and technologies I used in my numerical simulation projects include
- Adaptive meshed Finite Element methods with CPU parallelizatons on architecture with AVX2/AVX512 vectorization.
- CPU and GPU (CUDA/ROCm) parallelized Finite difference methods of Langvevin equations with tensor-valued order. parameters.
- CMake and GNU Make configurations and managements of complex source tree of HPC projects.
- Parallel postprocessing of HPC data and *insitu* visualizations of HPC stream data. 
- Python scripts, UNIX shell scripts and Mathematica notebooks.

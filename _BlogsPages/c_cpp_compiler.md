name: C/C++ Compilers
description: C/C++ is The Language Family, which high performance computations require. Though memory security of C/C++ is always under debated, most of developers will keep using it because its efficiency, abundant frameworks and GPU acceleration supports. In most case, daily compilations are done by either gcc or LLVM based compilers e.g., clang. However, given the rapidly renewed standards of C++, even figuring out which version of g++ is getting complicated. In additional, hardware vendors also provide their compliers to user e.g., nvcc, hpicc, aocc etc.

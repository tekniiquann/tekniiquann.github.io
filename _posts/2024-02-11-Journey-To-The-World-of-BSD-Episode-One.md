The historically impacts of [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) on computer science and computer technologies are going forever along every hardware ruining UNIX-like system. 
Unfortunately, quite often, the original creators of revolutionary ideas finally are not those, who boost the ideas into absolutely market success. The UNIX went through same history pattern,
as passed by the early success of 1980s, [UNIX war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_wars), then was substituted by [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). Except [Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) and [Sun OS/Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Solaris), generally people is not bothered to mention UNIX. Instead, [Berkeley Software Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution) family of operating system a.k.a BSD system, is the direct descendants of UNIX, which is mostly used as "BSD-UNIX" in modern time. This is the first episode of explore and using experiences of BSD as a ten years GNU/Linux user.

The BSD I chose is [FreeBSD 13](https://www.freebsd.org/), simply because it is mainstream, with nice documentations and source code, and also a cool looking logo.
